<h1>AJAX Atomics - 02</h1>

<script type="text/javascript" src="/global.js"></script>

<h2>What is the difference between this atomic and the first atomic?</h2>
<p>
  In this atomic, the files are not in the Public folder. They have route handlers in the app.rb files. One of the paths just has text, while the other has an erb file.
